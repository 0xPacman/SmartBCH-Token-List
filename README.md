# SmartBCH-Token-List

Community maintained SmartBCH token registry used on https://MarketCap.Cash

### How to add a token to the list and on MarketCap.Cash
1. Open an issue in this repository.
2. Add name, symbol, address, image, link to website and other social media.

FYI: The token needs to have some liquidity onchain preferably on Benswap.Cash (otherwise the price and marketcap would display oddly).
